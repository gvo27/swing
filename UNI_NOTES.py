Only save stable scripts (ones that don't error), unless if you ditch them, include a short tidbit of what they are and what they did (for recall)

Question: Quick side question actually just thought of this I used to work on apps script for google sheets and that was bottlenecked by the google servers themselves not my computer. Is running python purely from my computer? I have a i7 13700F so I would imagine it could handle coding stuff like this quickly, do I need to allocate more computing power or something? Yes but it has nothing to do with the CPU, you can ditch {Quick side question 

Python nested-loops bound, the new one is vectorized / precomputed-trades bound.

you might want to never overhaul existing scripts to support new features

don't think, just do

parquets are binary

ie : int and : float "type annotations" are only allowed in function definitions and dataclasses, not in function calls 

check for column names 

DO NOT UNPLUG ETHERNET WHEN RUNNING SCRIPTS

MAKE SURE YOU TYPE A MESSAGE INTO THE BRANCH BEFORE DELETING

Focus on these [ branches, it's okay to try something then going back 

GPT logic path can be different, so doing intentional branching can be a strat. When we first got the 1000+ CAGR it suggested the MR gate after I broke its sequence by not saying albation, and then going back to it it just did a simple gate with TP
